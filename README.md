# machine-learning-project-
built deep learning (transfer learning) and machine learning( keras, skearn) models to predict tree classifications; utilzied randomized search to select optimal models for tree-based (xgboost, adaboost, gradient boosting, etc) and non-tree based( LDA, QDA, SVM) algorithmns, also established feature selections based on random forrest; achieved the test accuracy of 99.49 as svm for tree-based models, and test accuracy of 99.5 for CNN+MLP models.
